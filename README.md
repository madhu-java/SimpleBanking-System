# SimpleBanking-System
In this project, you will develop a simple banking system with database.
In our banking system, credit cards should begin with 4.

The first six digits are the Issuer Identification Number (IIN). These can be used to look up where the card originated from. If you have access to a list that provides detail on who owns each IIN, you can see who issued the card just by reading the card number.

Here are a few you might recognize:

Visa: 4*****
American Express (AMEX): 34**** or 37****
Mastercard: 51**** to 55****
In our banking system, the IIN must be 400000.

The seventh digit to the second-to-last digit is the customer account number. Most companies use just 9 digits for the account numbers, but it’s possible to use up to 12. This means that using the current algorithm for credit cards, the world can issue about a trillion cards before it has to change the system.

We often see 16-digit credit card numbers today, but it’s possible to issue a card with up to 19 digits using the current system. In the future, we may see longer numbers becoming more common.

In our banking system, the customer account number can be any, but it should be unique. And the whole card number 16-digit length
2.
it creats a card number that satisfies the Luhn algorithm
lastly it stores and each card data in a table 
can read and update and delete the cards data from table
